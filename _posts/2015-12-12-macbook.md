The MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) is such a hardware engineering masterpiece... truly love the overall experience so far.

And yes, this does actually include the keyboard ;-)

I'm currently in the process of general (OS X) system setup and customization as well as to move "my stuff" onto my new _workhorse_... 

Will follow-up here w/ my learnings along the way as well as some details on the actual setup.
